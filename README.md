## Common issues

  If statements 
  - Make sure you are using the correct operator in the condition.
	
	If else 
	- Remember to use && (and) when you want both cases to be true and || (or) when you need only one of them to be true.
	
	If Statement Chaning
	- Missing "}" to close if statements.
	  Make sure you close the all the if statements, if you are not sure if you are 
	  missing one bracket you can put your cursor on left of the breckets then use your arrows to move it to the right, the open 
	  bracket that belongs to that one is going to highlight in yellow.
	  
  A classic Challenge
  - Remember that you cna use % to get the rreminder from a division.
